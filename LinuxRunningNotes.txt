states 
 
1. High avaliable 
2. security
3. netwroking

3. we are creating the server
===========================
7 steps

ec2

You can use a key pair to securely connect to your instance. 
Ensure that you have access to the selected key pair before you launch the instance.

File system Hierarchy:(FSH)
=======================
the linux file hierarchy structure or the FSH, defines the directories contenets and files.


sudo -i
home user to root user
#
 Root:
======
/bin/
/opt/
/boot/
/root/
/dev/
/sbin/
/etc/
/srv/
/home/

ls 
===
list of directories & files will be visible
Blue colors - will be identify the directories
white colors - will be identify the files

Ec2 instance/server/service

How to create multile directories:
===============================
mkdir d1 d2 d3 d4
how to remove the directory
===========================
rmdir d4
How to create multiple files:
===========================
touch f1 f2 f3 f4
how to remove the file
========================
rm -f f4
rm -f f2 f3

Short Cut Commnads:
======================
Linux/Unix Command
=========
1. File commands

ls - directory listing/ files listing
ls -al  - hidden files to be displyed
cd dir - change dir to dir
cd - change to home
rm file - delete file
rm -f filename - force remove file
rm -r dir -
rm -rf dir
cp file1 file2 - copy the file1 file2
cp -r dir1 dir2 - copy the dir1 dir2
mv file file2 - rename or move file1 dile2
touch file -
cat file - to see content inside file
more file - output the content of file
head file - output the first 10 lines of file
tail file -  output the last 10 lines of file
tail -f file - output the content of files as it grows, starting with the last 10 lines

Permissions and Rights
=========================
rights(ownership)
==============
files & directories level
chown
-rw-r--r--.
r - read   - 4
w - write  - 2
x - execute- 1
======================
             7
chown ec2-user file.txt

change ownership with group level
===========================
ec2-user

change the recursively of ownership
=======================
-R
chown -R root file.txt(filename)

mkdir test
cd test
file1 file2 file3 file4

chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user test

Permissions:
=============
chmod 
r - read   - 4
w - write  - 2
x - execute- 1

Example:
==============
d(directiroy)   rwx=4+2=1(7)-user	r-x(4+1=5)-Group	r-x(4+1)-others

rw-r--r- = 
us-g--others
644

user -r
group -r
other - w
rw-r-r
644

test
chmod 442 test.txt

directory
=============
user -7
group-0
others - 0
mydir
chmod -R 700 mydir

vim:
=============

Vim is powerfull text editor used in CLI(Command Line Interface).
Linux uses a lot of configuration files.
if you edit them and vim is a great tool do so, aletrnatively VIM is a command line editor

It has 3 modes:
----
1. Command Mode
2. Insert Mode -i
3. Extended Mode -
vim file.txt
hi team we are learing linux commands
it will be easy for us
shift g

Monitoring:
==============
top

ping command:
=================
ping Packet Internet Groperused to check the n/w connectivity
ping -c2 google.com

c - here "c" represents no.of hops you want as output.
incase we gave 2. hence we arr getting hopeand then its getting exited

vmstat command:
===============
vmstat 1 5

User administration:
=========================
user managemnet is an important part of Linux system administration
we need to perform diffrenet oprations such as adding, deleting, managing the account which is the part of servers
types of users in linux OS
================
1. Super user - root account
2. System User -system users are created by ssytem such as bin, game, ftp,name, mail,daemon, apache etc, nologin
3. Regular user: will be created by super user
regular user can login to the system, but has access limitations
/etc/passwd - is the file which is holding all the information about the system users in the machine

grep - global regular expression print

I have changed region
new EC2-Instance
Putty server

Software Mangement:
========================
2 types of softwares
1. RPM - Redhat package manager(rpm)
2. yum - yellow dog update manager(yum)


Linux Operating System:
========================
1. centos - yum
2. ubuntu - apt-get

install with Git software:
======================
centos - yum install git (yum install maven)
ubuntu - apt-get install git

DNS:
==========
Domain name specific
nslookup 

Change the Hostname:
====================
hostname linux.example.com

Real Time:
==========
dont stop the servers
if servers stopped means you need to take E-Mail confirmation

.pem file(public key) - this is storing by aws
.ppk file putty private key(private key) - you will be storing

cat /etc/os-release
